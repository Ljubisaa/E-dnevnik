### General Info
There is a need to keep student records online. As a professor I approached solving this problem. The technologies I have chosen are **Spring** and **Angular**, the base is **MySql**. Students should be divided into classes. Each student should have a grade from the oral and written exam. 
Except ***CRUD*** operations, there are other options: *search by name, display oral and written grades, option to get an average grade, display student details, etc*.

### Technologies Used
1. Java 15  
2. Spring
3. Angular 11 

### Project Status
Project is in progress, next step is deploying.
